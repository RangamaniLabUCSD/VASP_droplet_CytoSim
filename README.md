The repository contains CytoSim input files used to simulate droplets with actin filaments.
Results can be found here https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.26.542517

CytoSim can be downloaded directly from https://gitlab.com/f-nedelec/cytosim/-/blob/master/README.md\

Input files can be found inside folders named based on Figure numbers in which they appear in the manuscript.

Figure_NUMBER/INPUTFILES - carries inputfiles

Within the INPUTFILES folder, sub-folders are organized as follows. For example, if we studied 30 different conditions, and we considered 10 runs per-condition, would see folders labelled R_CONDITIONID_r_REPLICATEID
In the above exmaple, CONDITIONID spans 0 to 29 and REPLICATEID 0 to 9
